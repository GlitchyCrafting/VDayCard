			Oh, fair computer scientist, with code so bright,<br>
			Your love for tech is like a shining light.<br>
			In the realm of bits and bytes, you reign supreme,<br>
			With algorithms and data, your heart does gleam.<br>

			Your eyes are sparkling, like a screen in flight,<br>
			As you delve into the depths of the digital night.<br>
			You pore over lines of code, with dedication and might,<br>
			To bring to life the innovations that excite.<br>

			With every click and scroll, your passion does grow,<br>
			And the world is better, thanks to your know-how.<br>
			So here's to you, dear nerd, on this day of love,<br>
			May your computer screens be forever above.<br>
		</p>

		<h2>Reasons why I Appreciate You</h2>
